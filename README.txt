Implemented features (Program Integrity/Design):

- Letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper distribution of the letters

- Letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares

- The program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square

- The Scrabble board includes at least two bonus squares

- The User's score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers

- Any number of words (letters) can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles

- The board can be cleared after each round so that a new word can be played

- The User's score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart)

- Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere
else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.

- Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”.

- The User can always restart the game
